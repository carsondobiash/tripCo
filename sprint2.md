# Sprint 2 - *18* - *Rigatoni*

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: Daniel Chavez

## Definition of Done

* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint2.md).
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Increment deployed for demo and testing.
* Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
#### Configuration Management
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
#### Continuous Integration
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

In this sprint we plan to build onto our existing distance calculator by adding a mobile and responsive map itinerary. We will do this by completing the following epics:


* *TripCo: The solution must be responsive for mobile devices.*
* *All code shall be clean!*
* *User: I want to supply my own units for distances.*
* *User: I want a map and itenerary for my trip.*
* *All servers and clients must interoperate!*


*Each of us will start the project with two tasks, and if we find that more tasks need to be created during the project they will be divided up equally. Even though we all have seperate tasks we will collaborate and help each other out with the tasks. We will also split up any tasks that are bigger than orginally thought in order to keep the time estimates between 1 to 2 hours. Most importantly, communication will be constant and consistent in order to adress impediments as quickly and effieciently as possible.*

## Review

*This sprint had some good points, as well as some not-so-good points. Our team communicated well and effectively; however, learning new languages and types of programming can be challenging. Because of this, we didn't fully complete an epic although we made good progress toward completing them. More details follows:*

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 

*Describe the solution based on the completed epics and list the epics below.*

* *## epic title: comments*
* *None: We didn't finish an epic fully.*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 

*Describe capabilities not included in the release and list the epics below with an explanation.*

* *## epic title: explanation*
* *User:I want a map and itinerary for my trip: We did not get the picture to populate, instead it is just a string. Then also we didn't get the itinerary to populate from the json.*
* *TripCo: The solution must be responsive for mobile devices.: We did not get to this epic because we couldn't get the map to load, so this means that we couldn't test the mobile responsivenes.*

#### What went well

*Describe what went well during the sprint in general terms followed by a more detailed list.*

* Our communication throughout the sprint was very good, and everyone knew what was going on, even if it wasn't ideal exactly what was going on.
* Everyone was very helpful trying to work through problems that our other teammates were having.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions

*Describe what problems occurred during the sprint in general terms followed by a more detailed list.*

* Some group members started late into the sprint, which caused some stress and things to be potentially left unimplemented
* A couple issues occured while trying to understand the client to server interactions, took a lot of research and teammwork to figure out.

## Retrospective

*An introductory paragraph for your retrospective.*

#### What we changed this sprint

*Articulate specifically what you will do differently based on the retrospective from the previous sprint before the sprint starts.*

#### What we did well

*Articulate what went well at the end of the sprint.*

#### What we need to work on

*We absolutely need to work on our time management for tasks and epics. Its too volitile to continue working towards the end of the due date.*

#### What we will change next sprint 

*Next sprint, our team will focus on trying to meet more often before the sprint deadline. We will also try to divide the work up more evenly. Focusing on previously unfinished epics early on in the next sprint will be crucial to implementing future changes to our project.*
