# Teamwork Questionnaire for Jacob Augustine

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Texting would be the easiest way to reach me, but I can also do calls. I'm busy Monday, Wednesday, Friday with class and work
   from 9 to 6. On Tuesday and Thursday however I'm only busy from 11 to 2.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope that we will be able to make a useful and easy to use website, as well as grow in how to work with code as a team.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to improve on being able to write clean code with plenty of comments for others to understand. Also learning 
   on how to work on a team with actual coding.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I'm sure there will be a problem at some point with understanding one anothers code and thought process at times.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think it needs to be made clear then of what is expected of other team members and what goals others have in mind.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If the other person who did not do the work also gets an A then no. However, if only they are rewared for putting extra
   time in then I think it is ok.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I feel like it depends on the work load given each week and that is kinda hard to judge before 
   even seeing a project assignment for this class.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * It will depend on what people are good at as well making sure the work load is split up evenly
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I feel like if the person becomes too much of an issue then it does need to be reported to the teacher.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * It should be up to the majority on the quality of work. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Those that work at different times just need to be sure to get their work done and in in timely manner 
   to be checked by others.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I wouldn't mind it, but it also goes with what the work load is like for this class.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I can't be sure as I do not know what this class has in store but maybe once or twice a week depending.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * It should be at least a majority, but every team member would be nice before going in a spacific directrion.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Like I said before up to the majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * It is up to the rest of the group to speak out an voice their concern to the one dominating.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * It just needs to be comunincated to the rest of the team of how you feel and what needs to be done to fix it.
