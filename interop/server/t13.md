Server Interop T13

Observations

T13

Our server does not render a map on their client. When using their server if you load a file without optimization then it
doesn't render on our client. If an optimization is specified then everything works as it should. So this would lead me to
think that both of our severs need to find a way to deal with an optimization field not exsisting.
