Client T13

Observations

The UI is nice an small when opened. This allows for the user to not be lost. Then they also have all the options as to how
the server is run up top so that you can chose options before it has made the request to the server. The colors are good and
show what are buttons and what is just information that is displayed. Then the interop doens't seem to work, even with other 
teams and not just our teams. It doesn't run with team 00 which is the server the TA's use. So the interop may not be fully 
working here.
