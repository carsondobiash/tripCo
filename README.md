# Manifesto
### Friendliness 
  Team rigatoni emphasizes that workplace friendliness is a large factor in team moral as well as teamwork. Team rigatoni members should be as cohesize as each single noodle in a pasta dish. That means that members will embrace each others ideas and criticisms with maturity and compassion.
  
### Readable Code
  Team rigatoni values readable code so that all team members know what the code is doing. Wether that is through line spacing or comments throughout the code to follow what the code is doing. This will allow for the teams to be able to pickup where others left off without having to comb over the entire code and trying to figure out what random things do.
  
### Teamwork
  Our team stands by the principles of working as a team. During our projects we split up the work evenly in order to focus on our interests and get an even distribution of practice in each step of the development process. We cooperate, communicate, and collaborate in order to produce the best piece of code that we can.
  
### Communication
  Team communication will be critical to the success of rigatoni's projects. We will use resources like slack when not together, however in the lab with one another it is important that we make our ideas clear. It is also important that we express how we feel about the direction of the project. If one does not speak up and voice their opinion about how the project is going then the quality of the project will suffer.
 
# Expectations
  Team rigatoni expects all members to be present in class as well as timely with all submissions and pull requests. The goal is to create ann efficient team that is coordinated, communative, and effective.
  Team rigatoni will utilize communication in order to imporve our work. This means that we will use the communication methods that we think are appropriate, such as texting for when to meet up. Then also using slack to disscus the project and to ask for a review on a pull request. Through the use of communication we can stay connected and everyone will know what is going on with the project. 
  Along with communication, our team will also ensure that our code is clean and readable. Organized code is essential to a well functioning piece of software. This organization will be maintained through github, which we will all use properly to keep our code as professional and organized as possible.
