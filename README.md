# Manifesto
### Friendliness 
  Team rigatoni emphasizes that workplace friendliness is a large factor in team moral as well as teamwork. Team rigatoni members should be as cohesize as each single noodle in a pasta dish. That means that members will embrace each others ideas and criticisms with maturity and compassion.
  
### Readable Code
  Team rigatoni values readable code so that all team members know what the code is doing. Wether that is through line spacing or comments throughout the code to follow what the code is doing. This will allow for the teams to be able to pickup where others left off without having to comb over the entire code and trying to figure out what random things do.

  Team rigatoni will utilize communication in order to imporve our work. This means that we will use the communication methods that we think are appropriate, such as texting for when to meet up. Then also using slack to disscus the project and to ask for a review on a pull request. Through the use of communication we can stay connected and everyone will know what is going on with the project.
