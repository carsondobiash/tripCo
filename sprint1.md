* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *## RESTful Service for distance*
* *##Responsive Client for distance calculator*

*As a team we agreed to split up the work between all of us and then bring it together in order to deploy the final version for this sprint*


## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *RESTful Service for distance*
* *Responsive Client for distance calculator*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *none*

#### What went well
* *Once we knew what was going on and how things fit togeather coding the actual solution wasn't too hard.*
* *We did a resonably good job on keeping up on eachothers merge requests through github and slack.*
* *Inspecting elements on the localhost site provided a good way to inspect what was going on where.*
* *Everyone's sense of responsibility was good and got the things they needed to do done on time.*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *How to create pull requests via IntelliJ was a issue for many of us. So we ended up looking on piazza and using google in order to figure out how to commit and then make pull requests*
* *Learned that we would need to call functions from other peoples classes and that the classes had to be made before some could start their work. The solution to this was to make sure those that were making the classes would at least make the class and merge it to the master so others could work on it.*
* *Finding where to edit code in the repo and what needed to be added.*
* *We encountered a strange error while updating the version to v1.0 that caused the ./run command to fail. For some reason, the 1.0 jar was being created to early, so deleting that file and then running again fixed it.*

## Retrospective

#### What went well
* *Spliting up the work is something that worked well because then one person wasn't swampped with work*
* *Meeting up to try and run through everything we had was very helpful*
* *Using sorces like piazza as well as other people in the lab for help.*
* *Communication through slack was great and we encountered no issues on that front.*

#### Potential improvements
* *Next time it would be wise to find what issues need to be solved in the code in order for other issues/tasks to be completed early on. This way it gives other people enough time to work on there sections without having to wait for others.*
* *We as a team when we meet up, could talk about what we did in our code and how it works in order to cause less confusion. This would also save time from having someone trying to figure it out on their own.*
* *It would also be beneficial to speed up our start times, as to have more time to debug and solve issues.*

#### What we will change next time
* *Create a designated meet time that is not the day of the assignment being due.*
* *We will start earlier on the project.*
